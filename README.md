## Usage

This tool is most utilized by Users that are drafting multiple teams at the same time. In the `Active` tab you can see each of your drafts, the player pool, you're queue and a scrolling draft board. You cannot see who you've currently drafted on that specific team unless you scroll through the draft board or you click on your username. This tool allows you to view the team just by selecting the draft on the left hand side of your window.

1. Log into your Underdog account on `www.UnderdogFantasy.com`.

2. Right click on the chrome extension icon and choose `Options`. A new tab will open with an input box. Enter your Underdog username in the box and click `Save`.
